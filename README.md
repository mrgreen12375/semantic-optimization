## Discription 

This challenge was to produce a website for a marketing agency called Horiseon that meet accessibility standards. There for optimizing there site for search engines and creating a more discriptive codebase for other programmers that may need to access this websites code.

## Problems that were solved

1. Finding non-semantic elements
    - In this project there were many non-semantic div elements. After locating the div tags I analysed the content that was in the div and renamed the tag accordingly. In the case of this project I renamed these div elements to header, nav, img, section, article, aside and footer. 

2. Consolidating/Structuring stylings in html and css
    - There were many different class names with the same css stylings. I renamed the multiple class's to a single class name in html and css. After the renaming I deleted the extra class's that were unnecessary. The renamed examples in this project were class content-article and benefit-aside. 
    - I changed the div tag that was containing the navigation list in the header to a nav tag. Then updated the nav change in css to retain the styling.
    - There was a div element in html classed hero that was an empty element that rendered the image through a backround-image styling in css. I deleted the backround-image in css and change the div element in html to an img element to render the image through html. I kept the class hero to retain the styling.

3. alt attributes
    - I added alt attributes to all of the images. The alt discriptions were in relation to what you see in the image.

4. h1, h2, h3, h4
    - I changed the h2 in the footer to h4 which followed the structure of the accending order and the context of the footer. I then updated the h4 change in css to retain the styling.

5. Name of title
    - There was a generic title named "website". I changed the title to the company name "Horiseon" to be more discriptive to the website.
